### rain_code_matrix
---

This is a simple tui made using ratatui crate that renders rain code like from the matrix movie on the terminal.
I think it looks ok though the colour and character profiles can be improved.
There are no config files or argument passing, any customisation will require modifying the source code.

## usage

Clone and navigate to the project root folder, then
* $ cargo run --release

Sit back and watch.
